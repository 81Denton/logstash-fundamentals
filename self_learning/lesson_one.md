# Lesson One: Logstash Pipeline
Logstash is a form of ETL pipeline.

* **Extract** - Pull data out of something, or have data pushed to it.
* **Transform** - Manipulate the ingested data.
* **Load** - Publish the manipulated data in some kind of backing storage.

The name derives from its original goal of processing log-files produced by
applications, and saving them in a way that you can then query. There are
may for-profit applications that allow you to do this, but an open source
alternative is very attractive.
