# Self-Directed Lessons

This repository is intended to be a learning resource for Logstash. Rather than
attend a training session, this should provide a good set of instructions for
gaining comfort with Logstash.

* Lesson One: [Logstash pipeline][L1]
* Lesson Two: [Logstash configuration file][L2]
* Lesson Three: [Working with input plugins][L3]
* Lesson Four: [Testing it out for real][L4]
